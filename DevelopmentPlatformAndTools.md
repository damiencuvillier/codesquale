To make easier contributions, here is the development team work environment.

As the development in made with Java Language, we use Eclipse IDE with the following versions :
  * Eclipse 3.2 SDK
  * Language pack
  * EMF
  * VE 1.2.3\_jem
  * GEF
  * AntLR plugin
  * Amateras HTML Editor (for XML features)

We use the fifth version of java.

Endly, to build UML diagram, we use StarUML.
To build general diagrams, we use Dia.

Others software are often used to build document : FreeMind, Wink
To manage our "todo lists", we have recently started to use GanttProject. It keeps managing tasks clear and simple, even if it is not full featured, as we expected.

All these softwares are included in a VMWare image based on Ubuntu (6.10) Linux Distribution. VMWare is hosted on Windows XP SP2.
