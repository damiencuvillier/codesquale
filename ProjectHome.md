Detecting specific lack of quality in a software, especially in a huge one, can be a very difficult task. If you try to measure the software quality by yourself, you will realize that it is a complex job because there are no really performant and relevant tools.

The purpose of codesquale is to measure software (object oriented developped) quality by a static analyse (source code is not compiled) of source code.

Codesquale provides a powerful engine which analyses the source code of a given software and  build documented statistics about the global quality of the software.
