### Based on open source standard ###

Because it is not necessary to re-invent the wheel, Codesquale team choose to base his software on some open source standard.

[ANTLR](http://www.antlr.org/): provides Codesquale his performant parsing system. Moreover, the ANTLR parsing system is based on grammar files which will help codesquale to extend easily the code source language support in a near future.

[JFP (Java Plugin Platform)](http://jpf.sourceforge.net/) : provides the modularity and extensitivity to the Codesquale architecture. Moreover, it will help us to extend the functionnality of Codesquale and widely open it to community.
