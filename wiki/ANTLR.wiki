= Introduction =

ANTLR (Another Tool for Language Recognition) is a syntaxic and lexical analyser generator. It provides some tools to generate code in Java, C++, C#, from grammatical descriptions.

ANTLR knows how to build some recognition systems based on grammatical structure and then apply it on 3 types of entry:

  * lexer : A lexer (often called a scanner) breaks up an input stream of characters into vocabulary symbols for a parser, which applies a grammatical structure to that symbol stream

  * token stream parser : A parser takes a stream of tokens from a lexer and groups them into higher order constructions called productions.

  * tree-parsers (tree-walkers) : A more powerful parsing strategy is to build an intermediate representation that holds all or most of the input symbols and has encoded the relationship between those tokens, in the structure of the data.

== What does ANTLR generate? ==

The first language to be implemented in code squale will be Java. So, we will explain what ANTLR generate with a Java grammar file. 
ANTLR generates all the needed files to provides an efficient parsing system :

 * JavaLexer.java : Defines the lexer, a Token.java inherited class 
 * JavaRecognizer.java : Wich is the implementation for the parser
 * JavaTokenTypes.java : An interface wich defines all the Java language Tokens
