#This page describes the mechanism of the metrics collector engine.

= Introduction =

CodeSquale developpement is essentially based upon the XML technology associated to the so sexy Java.

Let me remind you how CodeSquale works to provide metrics and indicators on static code source.

1. The first step is the lexing and parsing of a selected file set of source code. ANTLR is responsible for accomplsihing this vital task. ANTLR takes as input source code files and deliver as output a XML tree representative of our source code.

2. As this tree is overloaded by useless data (in sense of these data are not useful for CS), we manage to transform this tree with help of XSLT. The result of the transformantion is a freshly generated light XML tree also representative of the code source structure.

3. The next step is what interest us : how metrics are being collected and calculated ?
