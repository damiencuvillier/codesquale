= Project Organization=
The project is organised by using short time iteration. Thus, the development team will be able to provide often some binaries.

We want to use the RUP (Rational Unified Process) to simplify our project organisation. By getting a lot of _quick wins_, the project evolution will be visible. 

= Main Steps =

 * 2007-03-30 : First Binary ==> Count numbers of classes, files and lines

= RELEASE NOTES =

== V 0.1 [2007-03-30] ==

       ===What's new===
First release of CodeSquale. It is an alpha version but produces few results.

       ===Functionnalities=== 
 * Analyses a set of java source files 
 * Counts some indicators and calculate one metric 
 * Display process of analysis on the console 
 * Export results into text files

       ===What's calculated ?===
Counters : 
          - Lines
          - Files
          - Classes
          - Methods
          - Interfaces
Metrics : 
          - Average number of method by class

       ===Download, install and uninstall===
This first release is not available for the moment because the CodeSquale team estimates that it was too little for the moment. But don't desperate, a new release is coming soon.

       ===Known issues===

* The second parameter (result output file) must be a valid file name.
