|| *CS Abbr.* || *Other Abbr.* || *Details* || *Description* || *Feature supported by CS* ||
||*CCIM*|| V(G) ||Cyclomatic complexity.||Number of paths tought a method. The higher the number, the more testing effort will be required to cover all paths. A method with no conditional struct will have a CCIR of 1.||_N/A_||
